# EC320 Lab 9

Here's the finale! I wanted to do something that covered interpreting lm results when logs are involved, and also multicollinearity, so I came up with this. Please work on houses1.R and houses2.R in order to submit your html versions by Friday, June 2 at 5pm. There are **no test files** for either of these, but make sure to scroll to the bottom of this page and you'll find a little tidyverse cheat sheet that you can keep in your back pocket for EC421 ðŸ˜Š.
