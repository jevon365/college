# EC320 lab 6

In this lab, you'll learn a little about typesetting math using LaTeX, and then you'll do a short data project on Love Island, practicing dplyr, ggplot, and lm.

WARNING: in love_island.R, we'll use a new function from a new package broom::tidy(). It puts lm results into a tidy tibble. But to use that function, you'll need to install the package first:

`install.packages("broom")`

And you're good to go!

There are no tests for these assignments and there is no video to watch. Come to office hours with questions (Wednesday 4-5:20 and Friday 8-9am) and make sure to upload your html versions of both LaTeX.R and love_island.R to Canvas before Friday at 5pm.
